The bidding was fairly competitive, with B2 closely following at 0.42, and B3 significantly lower at 0.112.

The bidding was quite competitive, particularly with B3's bid closely matching the clearing price of 0.3419.

Overall, B2's win for a clearing price significantly below their valuation (0.3824) indicates effective bidding strategy, allowing them a positive payoff of 0.0405.

In ROUND 7 of the auction, bidder B2 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.75, significantly higher than the second-highest bid from B3 at 0.476. The bids revealed a competitive environment, especially considering B1's lower bid of 0.303, which was below their value of 0.379. B2's bid was likely shaded, given their valuation of 0.823, indicating a well-calculated strategy to secure the win while still achieving a positive payoff of approximately 0.347. The clearing price of 0.476 is well below B2's valuation, illustrating the potential profitability of this auction for them.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 8):
In ROUND 8 of the auction, bidder B1 emerged victorious with a bid of approximately 0.752, just slightly above B2's bid of 0.75, making it a closely contested round. Both bidders B1 and B2 indicated strong valuations, with B1's perceived value of 0.94 suggesting their bid may have been slightly shaded to maximize payoff. The clearing price of 0.75 is below B1's valuation, resulting in a positive payoff for them, while B2 did not secure the item, leaving them with no payoff. This round illustrates the tension between competitive bidding and strategic shading, as B1 successfully navigated the threshold just barely to secure the win.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 9):
In Round 9 of the auction, bidder B3 emerged victorious with a bid of approximately 0.595, which was notably higher than the bids of B1 and B2. Although B3's winning bid exceeded the clearing price of 0.25, both B1 and B2 opted for significantly lower bids, suggesting less competitiveness. B1 and B2's offers seem shaded, as their bids were well below their respective valuations. The clearing price of 0.25 is modest in comparison to B3's valuation of about 0.794, highlighting B3's strong strategy to capture surplus while benefiting from lower bids from competitors.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 10):

The competition was quite fierce, with B1 and B3 also participating, but B2's higher bid secured their victory. Bids appear somewhat shaded, particularly B1's, which is close to the clearing price, suggesting a cautious strategy, while B2's bid reflects a strong belief in their valuation of 0.989. The clearing price of 0.565 is below their valuations, indicating a favorable outcome for B2, who retains a considerable payoff due to the second-price format.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 11):
In ROUND 11 of the auction, bidder B3 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.4523, surpassing the other bids and securing the item. The competition was quite close, with B1 and B2 bidding 0.2834 and 0.3, respectively, but both were outpaced by B3. The bids appear somewhat shaded, especially as B3's bid exceeded their actual value of 0.6030, suggesting confidence in the item's worth. The clearing price of 0.3 is beneficial, as it is below B2's valuation and well below B1's, indicating strategic undervaluing by the lower bidders. Overall, this round reflects a highly competitive atmosphere with insightful bidding strategies.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 12):
In ROUND 12 of the auction, bidder B2 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.8, while the clearing price settled at 0.4596—reflecting B2's second-price win. The competition was notable, with B1 placing a bid equal to the clearing price and B3 significantly lower, indicating B1's bid was initially competitive but ultimately insufficient. B2's high bid suggests a strategic shading; their valuation of 0.8854 indicates they valued the item more, allowing room for the competitive landscape. Overall, the price relative to the bids highlights a keen interest in the item, with B2 successfully leveraging their understanding of both market dynamics and their valuation edge.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 13):
In ROUND 13 of the auction, bidder B2 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.8, despite having a significantly lower value of 0.028. The clearing price was set at 0.2988, which reflects a competitive bidding scenario, particularly between B2 and B3, as B3 bid exactly at the clearing price. B1's lower bid suggests a more conservative or shaded approach, as their value was higher than their bid. Overall, this round highlights strategic bidding dynamics where bidders might be employing riskier strategies or misjudging their valuation.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 14):
In ROUND 14 of the auction, bidder B1 emerged victorious with a winning bid of approximately 0.4726, while the clearing price settled at 0.42. This indicates a competitive bidding environment, as B2 and B3 also placed strong bids near the clearing price, yet B1's bid was the highest. B1's valuation of 0.6387 suggests that their bid may have been slightly shaded to maximize payoff, while B2 and B3 seemed to bid closer to their values, possibly indicating a more conservative approach. Notably, the clearing price is quite a bit lower than B1's valuation, hinting that they strategically aimed for a win without overextending their bid.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 15):
In ROUND 15 of the auction, bidder B2 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.58, securing the item at a clearing price of 0.469, which indicates a strong competitive performance in an auction where B1 bid just under that price. The bids suggest a mix of strategies, as B1's bid closely matched the clearing price, indicating either a truthful valuation or a slight shading, while B3 was significantly lower, suggesting a less competitive stance. Overall, B2’s payoff of approximately 0.083 indicates that although they won, there is a noticeable gap between their bid and the clearing price compared to their own valuation of 0.552. This round highlights the importance of understanding true valuations versus strategy in bidding, as B2 successfully leveraged a higher bid without overpaying relative to their assessment of value.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 16):
In ROUND 16 of the auction, participant B2 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.75, securing the win despite the clearing price being set at 0.3894. The bidding was quite competitive, with B1 and B3 submitting significantly lower bids of 0.0985 and 0.3894, respectively. B2's bid appears to be shaded, given their value of 0.6737, suggesting a strategic decision to maximize potential payoff. Overall, the clearing price is notably below B2’s valuation, indicating room for higher bids in future rounds.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 17):
In ROUND 17 of the auction, Bidder B1 emerged victorious with a bid of approximately 0.55, winning at a clearing price of 0.05. The competition was relatively fierce, as the bids from B2 and B3 were significantly lower, suggesting that B1's bid may have reflected a stronger valuation of the item compared to the others. B1's substantial payoff indicates that their bid was likely truthful rather than shaded, as their valuation was about 0.75. Additionally, the low clearing price relative to the valuations highlights B1's strategic advantage, allowing them to secure the item at a price far below its perceived worth, maximizing their surplus.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 18):
In Round 18 of the auction, bidder B2 emerged victorious with a bid of 0.8, significantly higher than the second-highest bid of 0.3446 from bidder B1. This round showcased a competitive bidding environment, particularly between B2 and B1, while B3's bid seemed less competitive. B2’s bid appears to be a strategic valuation, as their willingness to pay exceeds their own value of 0.970, indicating a strong interest in the item. The clearing price is well below B1's valuation, suggesting they may have shaded their bid, aiming for a cost-effective win rather than bidding their true value.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 19):
In ROUND 19 of the auction, bidder B2 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.8, securing the item at a clearing price of 0.7111, making it a second-price auction where they pay the bid of B1. The competition was quite intense, as B1's bid was equal to the clearing price, indicating strong engagement from both. However, B2's value of 0.0422 suggests a heavily shaded bid, as their valuation is significantly below both their bid and the clearing price. This round highlights the complexity of bidder strategies, where B2 may have aimed to secure the item despite a low valuation, suggesting a potential tactical approach.
