The competition was modest, with B1 and B2 placing much lower bids of 0.15414906374043122 and 0.05, respectively. B3's bid may reflect a strategic inclination to secure the item at a price well below their valuation of 0.7685165343743444, suggesting a degree of shading. Overall, while the winning price aligns relatively well with B1's valuation, it indicates that the bidders were likely aware of their true values, especially based on the sizable gap between B3's valuation and their own bid.

In ROUND 1 of auction_001, bidder B1 emerged victorious with a bid of approximately 0.461, which was the highest among the participants. B1's winning bid exceeded B2’s low offer of 0.05 but closely matched B3's bid of 0.3926, indicating a competitive atmosphere among the bidders. B1's bid seems somewhat shaded given their valuation of 0.576, while B3's bid was nearly equal to the clearing price, suggesting a tactical approach.

The bids show a competitive dynamic, especially with B3’s bid aligning exactly with the clearing price, indicating a strategic attempt to win without overspending. B1's bid appears slightly shaded compared to their valuation of 0.598, suggesting a cautious approach, while B2's significantly lower bid reflects either a lack of confidence in the item's value or a strategic underestimation. Overall, the clearing price is well below the valuations, indicating robust competition among bidders who are valuing the item higher than the final price.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 3):
In Round 3 of the auction, bidder B1 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.7502, but they only need to pay the second-highest bid of 0.4415, which is significantly below their value of 0.9378. The competition was moderate, as B2's bid was quite low at 0.18, while B3 bid exactly the clearing price. B1's high bid suggests that their strategy was to bid truthfully, positioning themselves strongly to win.

The competition was fairly close, with B2 and B3 bidding 0.58 and 0.664, respectively, indicating a strong engagement among participants. B1's bid appears somewhat shaded given its higher margin over the clearing price, while the final price was well below their own valuation of 0.95, suggesting that B1 could have bid more confidently. Overall, this round highlights a strategic approach where B1 secured the win without overextending financially, capitalizing on the competitive but conservative bids of other participants.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 6):
In ROUND 6 of the auction, bidder B2 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.75, significantly higher than the next highest bid from B1 at 0.2259, which became the clearing price.

This round illustrates a notable disparity in bidding strategies, with B2's approach appearing more truthful compared to B1's less competitive bid, ultimately maximizing their payoff given the winning outcome.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 7):
In ROUND 7 of the auction, bidder B2 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.75, which surpassed the second-highest bid from B3 at 0.2281, resulting in a clearing price of 0.2281. The competition was moderate, with bids from B1, B2, and B3 indicating varied strategies, but B2's significantly higher bid suggests a strong intention to win rather than simply shade the bid. Given B2's valuation of 0.7088, the clearing price aligns more closely with B3's value of 0.3258, illustrating a strategic advantage for B2. Overall, this round highlights a willingness to pay a premium for winning, but also indicates that some bidders may have employed shaded bids, particularly B1, who did not compete aggressively.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 8):
In Round 8 of the auction, bidder B3 emerged as the winner with a bid of approximately 0.67, which was significantly higher than the next highest bid of B2 at 0.42. The competitive nature of the bidding is evident, with bids closely aligning to each bidder's valuations, particularly B2 and B1 who both bid lower than their true values. The clearing price of 0.42 is below B3's valuation of 0.95, suggesting that while B3's bid was strategic to secure victory, B2 and B1's bids were likely shaded as they didn’t fully reflect their respective valuations. This round highlights the importance of balancing risk and reward in bid strategy, especially when the competition is tight.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 9):
In ROUND 9 of the auction, bidder B3 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.465, securing the item at a clearing price of 0.3, which was lower than their value of 0.659. The competition was relatively tight, with B1 and B2 bidding 0.175 and 0.3, respectively, suggesting that B2 was closer to the true market value but ultimately did not outbid B3. The bids appear somewhat shaded, particularly B1's, which is significantly below their declared value. B3's strong bid indicates an aggressive strategy, highlighting their confidence in valuing the item highly compared to the others.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 10):
In Round 10 of the auction, bid 'B2' emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.96, significantly higher than the second-highest bid of 0.5752 from 'B1', leading to a clearing price of approximately 0.7084. The competition was reasonable given the spread between bids, with 'B3' valuing the item highest at about 0.9838 but not bidding aggressively. Overall, the bids seem somewhat shaded as bidders appear to be strategically underbidding their true valuations to enhance potential payoffs; 'B2' secured a payoff of approximately 0.2508, benefiting from their aggressive bid. The clearing price reflects a solid but not overly inflated market expectation, sitting well below both 'B2' and 'B3's true values.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 11):
In ROUND 11 of the auction, bidder B2 emerged victorious with a bid of 0.75, successfully securing the item at a clearing price of approximately 0.4643. The competition was notable, as B1 and B3 both offered bids significantly lower than B2, indicating a less aggressive bidding strategy from them. B2's bid appears somewhat shaded compared to their maximum valuation of approximately 0.6644, suggesting a strategic approach to winning the item while maximizing payoff. The clearing price is below B2's valuation, resulting in a positive payoff of about 0.2001, highlighting an effective balance between bidding high enough to win while keeping costs below their perceived value.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 12):
In ROUND 12 of the auction, bidder B1 emerged victorious with a bid of approximately 0.427, winning against B2 and B3 due to their lower bids of 0.3 and 0.355, respectively. The bidding was competitive, but B1's strong bid was significantly above both competitors, suggesting a strategic approach to ensure a win. Given that B1's valuation of 0.534 exceeds the clearing price of approximately 0.355, it seems likely that their bid was somewhat shaded rather than fully truthful. Overall, B1 secured valuable surplus, while B2 and B3 did not find enough incentive to raise their bids despite their own valuations.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 13):
In ROUND 13 of the auction, bidder B2 emerged victorious with a bid of 0.75, securing the win against B1 and B3 due to their lower bids. The competition was notably high, as B3 bid exactly at the clearing price of 0.675, but ultimately did not win because B2's bid was higher. The bids seem somewhat shaded, as B1's bid was significantly below their value, indicating a conservative strategy, while B2's bid was close to their valuation. Overall, the clearing price of 0.675 is advantageous compared to B2’s value of 0.663, resulting in a minimal negative payoff. This indicates a cautious approach, likely influenced by the competitive dynamics of the round.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 14):
In ROUND 14 of the auction, bidder B3 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.6398, which was above the second-highest bid from B2 at 0.58, leading to a clearing price of 0.58. The competition was relatively fierce, with all bidders showing strong interest, but B3's bid reflects a strategic choice likely informed by their high personal valuation of 0.8886. Interestingly, the bids appear somewhat shaded, as B1 and B2 both bid substantially below their valuations, indicating they may have underestimated their true willingness to pay. Overall, B3's ability to secure the item at a price that was less than their valuation suggests effective bidding strategy and confidence in their value assessment.

Auctioneer Summary (Round 15):

The competition was moderately fierce, with B1 bidding close at 0.2534, while B2's bid was significantly lower at 0.18. B3's bid appears to have been a strategic shade below their true valuation of 0.7803, ensuring they paid the clearing price of 0.2534 without exceeding their maximum willingness to pay. This round highlights the effectiveness of bidding just enough to win, as evidenced by B3's substantial payoff of 0.5269, indicating a well-calibrated strategy compared to the lower bids from B1 and B2.

This round showcased competitive bidding, particularly from B2, whose valuation was 0.781, suggesting a strategic but not overly shaded approach. The clearing price of approximately 0.312 is well below B2's valuation, indicating a potential advantage in their bidding strategy and leaving room for profit within their perceived value.
