AUCTION SIMULATION LOG
============================================================

--- ROUND 0 ---
B1: bid=0.9600
  reasoning: The best response calculator suggests a bid of 0.96, which is close to my private value of 0.9047, maximizing the chance of winning while ensuring positive expected utility. As there are no prior rounds to analyze, following the recommendation is a strategic choice.
B2: bid=0.3000
  reasoning: The best-response calculator suggests a bid of 0.3, which could maximize my chances of winning while still giving me a small utility margin based on the expected outcome. Since there are no historical rounds to inform my strategy, following the recommendation is prudent at this stage.
B3: bid=0.2500
  reasoning: I am following the best-response calculator's recommendation as it suggests a bid of 0.25, which is just above my private value. Since there have been no previous rounds, this bid gives me a chance to win without risking too much above my valuation, potentially yielding a positive utility if I win against unknown competition.
Winner: B1, Clearing Price: 0.3000
Summary: In ROUND 0 of the auction, participant B1 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.96, significantly higher than the next highest bid of 0.3 from B2, leading to a clearing price of 0.3. The bidding was competitive, but B1's value of approximately 0.90 indicates that their bid was somewhat shaded rather than fully truthful. B2 and B3 both received payoffs of 0, suggesting they underestimated their values or were too conservative in their bids. Overall, this round demonstrates a clear strategic advantage for B1, emphasizing the importance of accurately assessing one's own value in competitive bidding scenarios.

--- ROUND 1 ---
B1: bid=0.4200
  reasoning: I am following the best response calculator's recommendation to bid 0.42. This bid is just below my private value and aligns with my goal of maximizing utility while ensuring a high chance of winning, given my previous win at a much higher bid. The calculator suggests that this bid should yield an expected utility, and deviating significantly may risk not winning at all.
B2: bid=0.3000
  reasoning: Considering my private value of 0.380 and the highest previous bid was 0.96, I will choose to shade my bid lower to 0.3. It aligns with my known value and previous outcomes show I didn't win even with a higher bid. This strategy minimizes loss while testing if I can still compete effectively without risking more than I value the item.
B3: bid=0.5800
  reasoning: I will follow the best response calculator's recommendation of 0.58, as it provides a decent expected utility of 0.092 and positions me competitively given that my private value is 0.6399. Previous outcomes indicate that lower bids could lead to winning against bidders with less aggressive bids.
Winner: B3, Clearing Price: 0.4200
Summary: In Round 1 of the auction, bidder B3 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.58, beating out B1 and B2, who bid 0.42 and 0.30, respectively. The competition was moderately intense, with B1 closely matching the clearing price of 0.42, suggesting some level of shading, as they valued the item at 0.426. B3’s bid not only secured them the win but also allowed them to pay only the second-highest bid price, resulting in a significant payoff of approximately 0.22, indicating they had a strong valuation compared to what they paid. This round illustrates the importance of strategic bid positioning, as B3's willingness to submit a higher bid ultimately led to a profitable outcome.

--- ROUND 2 ---
B1: bid=0.2500
  reasoning: The calculator recommends a bid of 0.25, which is a strategy I should follow to maximize my utility while still being competitive. My private value is 0.217955, and bidding at the recommended level provides the best chance to win against previously observed bids. Given that my last bid of 0.42 lost to a 0.58 bid, I recognize that the competition may be bidding higher. This approach balances my utility against the price I may need to pay while optimizing my potential to win.
B2: bid=0.7500
  reasoning: The calculator recommends a bid of 0.75, which is just below my private value of 0.752. Given that only B1 has shown a higher bid (0.96), and considering I have no data indicating B3's maximum bid potential, I can follow the recommendation to maximize my chance of winning while still being competitive against B1. Additionally, the expected utility remains positive at this bid level.
B3: bid=0.7600
  reasoning: The recommendation is to bid 0.75, which offers an expected utility of 0.178. Analyzing the bidding history, B1 seems to have a strong tendency to bid high, and since my private value is 0.785, bidding slightly above the recommendation at 0.76 allows me to cover the potential second-highest bid while still providing positive utility if I win. This deviation aims to improve my chances against aggressive bidding from B1 while keeping my bid below my private value.
Winner: B3, Clearing Price: 0.7500
Summary: In ROUND 2 of the auction, participant B3 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.76, slightly exceeding their valuation of 0.785, while B2's bid of 0.75 set the clearing price. The competition was tight, with B1 only offering 0.25, suggesting a significant gap in belief about the item's value among participants. B3's bid seems to be shaded, but it aligns closely with their valuation, leading to a payoff of approximately 0.035. The winning price of 0.75 is strategically advantageous, as it indicates that B2 was willing to pay close to its value, yet lower than B3's maximum willing bid.

--- ROUND 3 ---
B1: bid=0.0000
  reasoning: Given my private value of 0.02507205183592298 and the recommendation to bid 0.0, I anticipate that the other bidders have been consistently bidding above my value based on their previous bids. Historical bids show that I only won the first round with a significantly higher bid, while in the subsequent rounds, the bids of B2 and B3 surpassed my private value. Thus, following the recommended strategy of bidding 0.0 maximizes my utility given that I expect not to win at a price I cannot afford.
B2: bid=0.9600
  reasoning: Following the calculator's recommendation to bid 0.96 allows me to compete closely with previous high bids while maximizing my expected utility. Previous rounds show that B1 often bids high, but with my private value being higher than the expected utility from lower bids, I have a potential winning edge.
B3: bid=0.0500
  reasoning: Following the calculator's recommendation again, as it suggests a bid likely gives a small positive utility based on the history and my private value. Given past unsuccessful rounds, it appears opponents might bid lower again. Bidding to the recommendation maintains competitiveness without exceeding my maximum utility threshold.
Winner: B2, Clearing Price: 0.0500
Summary: In Round 3 of the auction, participant B2 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.96, significantly outpacing the other bids. The bidding was quite competitive, with B3 submitting a bid of 0.05 and B1 opting not to bid at all, indicating a stark difference in perceived value among the bidders. B2's bid appears to be truthful, as it is well above their valuation of 0.93, while B3's bid closely matches their low valuation, suggesting a strategic approach rather than strong confidence. The clearing price of 0.05 was notably lower than B2's value, resulting in a substantial payoff for them while others did not gain any value from their bids. Overall, this round highlighted the strength of B2’s position in the auction, showcasing effective bidding strategy amid varying levels of confidence among the competitors.

--- ROUND 4 ---
B1: bid=0.5800
  reasoning: I will follow the best-response calculator's recommendation to bid 0.58, as it suggests a positive expected utility. This bid is optimal given my private value of 0.609, allowing me to potentially win while minimizing my payment based on the second-highest bid. Observing previous rounds, bidding lower has not been effective, and the calculator's recommendation appears to maximize my chances.
B2: bid=0.0200
  reasoning: The best bid from the calculator is 0.0, which aligns with my historical outcomes where competing bids have been much higher than my private value. I aim to slightly shade my bid to 0.02 to potentially win against lower bids while minimizing my payout if I do win, given my private value is low.
B3: bid=0.9500
  reasoning: I am shading my bid slightly below the optimal recommendation of 0.96 because in the previous rounds, bidding too close to the highest competitor's bids resulted in winning by a narrow margin without maximizing potential utility. I aim to win with a lower price while still being competitive.
Winner: B3, Clearing Price: 0.5800
Summary: In Round 4 of the auction, bidder B3 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.95, significantly outpacing the other bids. Despite their high bid, B3 only pays the second-highest bid of 0.58, indicating that the competition was not particularly fierce between B1 and B2, who bid much lower. B1's value hints at a careful strategy, as they did not shade their bid, while B2's minimal bid suggests a lack of serious intent. Overall, B3's winning bid reflects a strong understanding of their value relative to the competition, securing a payoff of 0.39 while still benefiting from a price well below their valuation.

--- ROUND 5 ---
B1: bid=0.4000
  reasoning: Considering the history, I see that B3 has been winning frequently. Bidding slightly above the calculator's recommendation of 0.42 minimizes my risk while increasing my chances of winning if I can undercut B3's bids. Based on past auctions, B3 often bids higher than my private value, so a small bid like 0.4 gives a utility if I win without significantly risking my private value.
B2: bid=0.5800
  reasoning: Following the best response calculator's recommendation of 0.58, as it provides a balance between being competitive and not overshooting my private value. I have observed that bids around this range have been moderately successful in past rounds, particularly since it maximizes potential utility while staying below my private value.
B3: bid=0.1800
  reasoning: Following the best-response calculator's recommendation as it suggests a bid that slightly exceeds competitors' average bids while staying under my private value. This maximizes the expected utility of winning since I’ve observed that winning bids have generally been lower than suggested maximums, allowing room for potential profit without overcommitting.
Winner: B2, Clearing Price: 0.4000
Summary: In ROUND 5 of the auction, bidder B2 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.58, outbidding B1, who submitted a bid of 0.4. The competition was moderate, as B1's bid reflected a valuation close to its submitted amount, suggesting a less aggressive strategy. The clearing price of 0.4 is below B2's valuation of 0.64, indicating B2 might have shaded their bid strategically to secure the win while maximizing payoff at 0.24. Overall, bidders seemed to balance honesty and strategy, with B2 effectively capturing value in this round.

--- ROUND 6 ---
B1: bid=0.2800
  reasoning: Given my private value is 0.3458, I want to bid slightly below the calculator's recommendation of 0.3. This approach takes into account my previous outcomes where overly aggressive bids did not yield wins, and allows me to remain competitive. The recent rounds show that my competitors often bid above 0.3, so a bid of 0.28 may give me a good chance of winning without overpaying.
B2: bid=0.5800
  reasoning: The calculator recommends 0.58 as the optimal bid, which aligns with my private value and past bidding history. It seems B1 is generally bidding lower, while B3 tends to bid higher. By matching the recommended bid, I aim to secure the win without overpaying, maximizing my expected utility based on the latest trends.
B3: bid=0.4200
  reasoning: The calculator suggests 0.42 as the optimal bid for a positive expected utility. Based on my bidding history, I have previously won at this level and lower, showing that bidding truthfully according to the best response may maximize my chances while staying under my private value.
Winner: B2, Clearing Price: 0.4200
Summary: In ROUND 6 of the auction, bidder B2 emerged victorious with a bid of 0.58, winning at a clearing price of 0.42. The competition was quite fierce, as bids from B1 and B3 were also substantial, but B2's bid demonstrated the highest willingness to pay. B2's bid appears to be somewhat shaded, given the substantial gap between their bid and the second-highest bid of 0.42 from B3, while the price of 0.42 is still below B2's value of approximately 0.63, allowing for a positive payoff. This round illustrates that bidders may be strategically estimating competitor valuations, while B2 capitalized on this to secure a favorable outcome.

--- ROUND 7 ---
B1: bid=0.3000
  reasoning: Following the calculator's recommendation of 0.3 aims to maximize expected utility based on past outcomes. My private value is 0.309, and I believe this bid aligns closely with competitors' recent trends while allowing for a potential win without overcommitting.
B2: bid=0.4200
  reasoning: The best response calculator suggests a bid of 0.42 with a positive expected utility. My previous rounds show B3 frequently bidding high, while B1's bids seem less aggressive. Bidding 0.42 aligns with the recommendation and is likely competitive without overshooting my private value.
B3: bid=0.1800
  reasoning: Following the best response calculator's recommendation, which suggests a bid of 0.18 to maximize utility given my private value. The previous rounds indicate that bids should not exceed my private value significantly, and this bid positions me competitively without overcommitting.
Winner: B2, Clearing Price: 0.3000
Summary: In ROUND 7 of the auction, bidder B2 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.42, significantly higher than the bids from B1 and B3. The competition was fairly intense, as B1 bid 0.3, which was just enough to match the clearing price. B2's bid suggests a strong belief in their own valuation of 0.476, indicating a possibly truthful approach, while B1’s bid fell short of their estimated value, hinting at a more cautious strategy. With the clearing price set at 0.3, B2 achieved a substantial payoff, reflecting the effectiveness of their bidding strategy in maximizing value beyond the competition's offers.

--- ROUND 8 ---
B1: bid=0.5000
  reasoning: Given my private value of 0.67 and the calculator's recommendation of 0.75, I am opting to shade my bid slightly to 0.5. This strategy accounts for recent patterns showing other bidders tend to bid lower to win, allowing me to compete effectively while maximizing potential utility if I win, as the second highest bids in past rounds have been below my private value.
B2: bid=0.0500
  reasoning: The best-response calculator suggests a bid of 0.05, which aligns with my private value of 0.065. Bidding this amount gives me an expected utility, and it aligns with previous rounds where higher bids were less successful against higher competitors. It's a strategic balance to maximize utility while remaining competitive.
B3: bid=0.7000
  reasoning: I have observed that my previous higher bids have secured wins, while lower bids tend to lose. The calculator recommends 0.75, but I adjust to 0.7 to still remain competitive while maximizing utility against the possible second-highest bid based on past outcomes.
Winner: B3, Clearing Price: 0.5000
Summary: In ROUND 8, bidder B3 emerged victorious with a bid of 0.7, securing the win by offering the highest amount in a competitive environment where B1 and B2 bid 0.5 and 0.05, respectively. B3's bid, while above the clearing price of 0.5, suggests strategic shading, as their true valuation is 0.6591, indicating an adjustment to win without overpaying. The overall bidding reveals significant competition from B1, whose bid closely aligns with their valuation, while B2's low offer seems uncompetitive. Notably, B3's payoff reflects effective bidding strategy, maximizing utility while navigating the second-price format.

--- ROUND 9 ---
B1: bid=0.1800
  reasoning: Following the calculator's recommendation gives me a small expected utility. I have noticed that higher bids tend to lose consistently in past rounds, while my previous bids sometimes performed well at lower values. This bid aligns with my private value while potentially securing a win if other bidders bid lower based on historical patterns.
B2: bid=0.0500
  reasoning: The best response calculator suggests a bid of 0.05, which may allow me to win if my competitors continue to shade their bids downwards as previously observed. Given my private value is quite low, this bid minimizes my risk while preserving utility should I win.
B3: bid=0.2500
  reasoning: Following the best-response calculator's recommendation of 0.25 as it provides a balanced approach in line with my private value. In previous rounds, higher bids have led to losing, while my lower bids have won at times. This bid aims to optimize utility given my value while remaining competitive.
Winner: B3, Clearing Price: 0.1800
Summary: In ROUND 9 of the auction, bidder B3 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.25, successfully outbidding B1 and B2, whose bids were 0.18 and 0.05, respectively. The competition was moderate, as B1's bid was very close to the clearing price of 0.18, suggesting some strategic shading, while B2's bid appears significantly lower and less competitive. With a winning payoff of approximately 0.031, B3's bid aligns well with their valuation of 0.211, indicating a calculated approach to maximize their utility. Notably, this round highlights the importance of understanding one's valuation versus the bidding landscape to secure a win efficiently.

--- ROUND 10 ---
B1: bid=0.5000
  reasoning: I will bid 0.5, slightly lower than the suggested best bid of 0.58. This value is above my private value yet less than the observed higher bids from others, particularly from bidder B3, who has consistently outbid me. This bid could give me a chance to win if B3 doesn't bid too high or decides to lower their bid based on the previous trends.
B2: bid=0.4500
  reasoning: Given my private value of 0.4568, bidding slightly above the calculator's recommendation of 0.42 will increase my chances of winning while still allowing for a positive utility. The history shows I have won with similar bids previously, and competitors may be bidding conservatively after observing my recent wins.
B3: bid=0.3250
  reasoning: My private value is higher than the suggested best bid of 0.3, and I've had success winning with bids around my private value in the past. Bidding 0.325 allows for a potential win with a low second-highest bid payoff.
Winner: B1, Clearing Price: 0.4500
Summary: In ROUND 10 of the auction, bidder B1 emerged as the winner by submitting the highest bid of 0.5, just above B2's bid of 0.45. The competition was relatively strong, with B2 attempting to secure the item close to their valuation of 0.4568. B1's bid appears somewhat shaded, staying below their true valuation of approximately 0.5675, while B3's significantly lower bid indicates a less competitive stance. The clearing price of 0.45 is well below B1's valuation, providing a substantial payoff, highlighting a strategic advantage for B1 in recognizing the bidding dynamics.

--- ROUND 11 ---
B1: bid=0.3900
  reasoning: The best bid recommended is 0.42, but my private value is 0.396. Bidding slightly below my private value helps in avoiding overpayment while staying competitive against previous bids. Analyzing the history, competitors often bid lower than their secret values, suggesting room to win with a lower bid.
B2: bid=0.3000
  reasoning: Following the best-response calculator's recommendation, which suggests a bid of 0.3, aligns with my private value. Historical data indicates that B3's bids tend to be higher, so this bid keeps me competitive without risking my utility significantly.
B3: bid=0.1000
  reasoning: Given my private value is 0.146, and the best bid suggested is 0.14, I will bid slightly lower at 0.1. This strategical shading accounts for the observed past bids where I often encountered high competitor bids, specifically from B1, while maintaining a potential to win without overspending. My last few wins show that I'm generally successful with bids below 0.2, while B1 has bid higher and seems eager to win. Thus, a bid of 0.1 maximizes my expected utility without risk of overpayment.
Winner: B1, Clearing Price: 0.3000
Summary: In ROUND 11 of the auction, bidder B1 emerged as the winner, submitting a bid of 0.39, which was the highest. The bidding was competitive, as B2 followed closely with a bid of 0.3, while B3's bid of 0.1 lagged behind. B1's bid seems somewhat shaded compared to their true valuation of approximately 0.40, suggesting a strategic approach to maximize utility, while B2's bid appears to reflect a more truthful valuation given the outcome. The clearing price of 0.3 is below B1's valuation, indicating a favorable payoff for them, highlighting the effectiveness of their bidding strategy.

--- ROUND 12 ---
B1: bid=0.6600
  reasoning: Considering my private value of 0.66657, I will bid slightly lower than the calculator's recommendation of 0.75 to maximize potential utility while still being competitive. Recent histories show that lower bids have often not won, but competitive bids still maintain higher expected utility.
B2: bid=0.3000
  reasoning: Following the calculator's recommendation of 0.3 aligns with previous rounds where similar bids have performed adequately. Given my private value is slightly higher, this bid maximizes my chances of winning without overpaying, while the second highest bids in recent rounds suggest that this amount remains competitive.
B3: bid=0.0500
  reasoning: Following the best-response calculator's recommendation, as it suggests a bid of 0.05. Analyzing previous rounds, I see that significant bids from B1 often led to my victory at lower bids. Bidding at 0.05 gives me a chance to win while minimizing my cost, as I have observed that B1 typically bids high, and I can benefit from that pattern without exceeding my private value.
Winner: B1, Clearing Price: 0.3000
Summary: In ROUND 12, bidder B1 emerged victorious with a bid of 0.66, winning the auction at a clearing price of 0.3, which indicates a comfortable margin over the second-highest bid from B2. This round showcased competitive bidding, particularly between B1 and B2; however, B3's significantly lower bid suggests a lack of competitiveness. B1's bid appears truthful, as it is well above the clearing price and closely aligns with their valuation, while B2's bid seems more strategic, possibly shaded to avoid overpaying. Overall, B1's payoff reflects the value they placed on the item, maximizing their surplus at this price point.

--- ROUND 13 ---
B1: bid=0.7500
  reasoning: The best response calculator suggests a bid of 0.75, which aligns with my private value. Given my recent bidding history, this amount should allow me to secure a win against my competitors, particularly since they have exhibited lower bids in most recent rounds.
B2: bid=0.8000
  reasoning: Given my private value of 0.874 and the observed patterns in the bidding history, especially that B1 often bids lower than their actual value, I believe that a bid of 0.8 will likely win against B3's typical bids. Also, bidding higher than the calculator's recommendation might yield a better outcome since I've had success recently with bids around this value.
B3: bid=0.0000
  reasoning: Given the recommendation from the best-response calculator suggests a bid of 0.0, it indicates that based on historical outcomes, the optimal strategy is not to bid. My previous wins have often occurred with bids below 0.3. Additionally, the observed behavior of other bidders shows that B1 tends to place higher bids recently. Thus, my decision to match the calculator's recommendation seems appropriate for maximizing expected utility.
Winner: B2, Clearing Price: 0.7500
Summary: In ROUND 13 of the auction, bidder B2 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.80, which surpassed B1's bid of 0.75. The competition was relatively close, reflecting a solid engagement between the bidders, but B2's higher bid ultimately secured the win. B2's bid appears to be somewhat shaded, as it is above their value of 0.87, while B1's bid closely aligns with their value of 0.73, indicating potential truthfulness. The clearing price of 0.75 is notably lower than B2's value, suggesting that while they won, there was room for strategic bidding to capitalize on perceived value without risking a higher financial commitment.

--- ROUND 14 ---
B1: bid=0.3000
  reasoning: I am following the best response calculator's recommendation of bidding 0.3. Given that my private value is 0.3278, this bid allows me to potentially win without overpaying. The recent history shows that bids higher than this often lead to losses or very narrow margins, making this a strategic choice to maximize utility.
B2: bid=0.7500
  reasoning: Following the calculator's recommendation to bid 0.75 aligns with my private value and expected utility gains. Recent rounds show that higher bids from my competitors could allow this bid to win. This maximizes my chances of a positive outcome, given the recent history of bids.
B3: bid=0.0000
  reasoning: The calculator recommends bidding 0.0, which aligns with my private value. Given the bidding history, other bidders have been submitting higher bids in recent rounds, and I have often lost when bidding higher. Bidding 0.0 minimizes my loss chances against high bids.
Winner: B2, Clearing Price: 0.3000
Summary: In Round 14 of the auction, bidder B2 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.75, beating out B1's bid of 0.3. The competition was relatively strong, as B1 was willing to bid close to their true valuation of 0.33, while B2’s bid exceeded their valuation of 0.73, suggesting a potential shading strategy to secure the win against lower bids. The clearing price of 0.3 is significantly below B2's valuation, allowing them to achieve a substantial payoff of 0.43. This round highlights the importance of strategic bidding, where B2's higher bid not only secured the item but also positioned them favorably against lower competitors.

--- ROUND 15 ---
B1: bid=0.9600
  reasoning: Following the calculator's recommendation of 0.96 is optimal because it reflects a competitive bid against observed values while maximizing potential utility based on my private value.
B2: bid=0.4200
  reasoning: Following the best response calculator's recommendation, as it suggests a bid of 0.42, which is slightly below my private value. This should maximize expected utility based on the game's previous outcomes and the observed behavior of competitors.
B3: bid=0.5800
  reasoning: The best response calculator recommends a bid of 0.58, which aligns with my private value and past performance. Winning with this bid will likely maximize my utility, as I obtained a positive utility of 0.08398579054610855 at this bid level in previous rounds. Additionally, I have observed that often, my bids in close proximity to the suggested value yield favorable outcomes.
Winner: B1, Clearing Price: 0.5800
Summary: In Round 15 of the auction, Bidder B1 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.96, significantly outpacing the second-highest bid from B2 at 0.42. This round showcased competitive bidding, but B1's strategy of shading their bid just below their true valuation of approximately 0.996 suggests a cautious yet strong approach. The clearing price of 0.58 is relatively low compared to B1's valuation, allowing them to enjoy a substantial payoff of about 0.416. This round highlights the effectiveness of bidding strategies that balance competitiveness with valuation understanding.

--- ROUND 16 ---
B1: bid=0.2000
  reasoning: I chose to bid 0.2, slightly below my private value and also below the recommended bid of 0.25, to increase my chances based on observed competitor patterns. The bidding history indicates that I've won with bids around the 0.3 mark before but faced competition from aggressive bidders like B3. Since my private value is 0.24438853457779863, a bid of 0.2 allows for a potential utility if I win, balancing the risk while still being competitive.
B2: bid=0.5500
  reasoning: The best-response calculator suggests a bid of 0.55, which allows me to remain competitive without exceeding my private value. Observing the history, bids from others often fluctuate, but they have bid above 0.55 only when they have higher secret values. This reflects my belief that bidding my recommended amount could yield a win while minimizing payment. Following the recommendation aligns with maximizing expected utility given my private value.
B3: bid=0.2500
  reasoning: The best-response calculator suggests a bid of 0.25, which aligns with my maximum willingness to pay based on my private value. Historically, bids above this value have failed against larger bids from competitors, indicating caution. By bidding 0.25, I can match the recommendation while minimizing overpayment risks based on my observations.
Winner: B2, Clearing Price: 0.2500
Summary: In ROUND 16 of the auction, bidder B2 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.55, securing victory over B1 and B3, whose bids were 0.2 and 0.25, respectively. The bidding was competitive, especially since B3's bid closely matched the clearing price of 0.25; however, B1's significantly lower bid indicates a lack of competitiveness on their part. Bidders likely shaded their bids, as B2's bid far exceeded their valuation of 0.54, aiming to win without overpaying significantly. Overall, the clearing price reflects strategic bidding, sitting comfortably between B3's valuation and B2's own, highlighting an effective strategy to balance competitiveness with valuation insight.

--- ROUND 17 ---
B1: bid=0.5800
  reasoning: Based on the best response calculator's recommendation to bid 0.58, it aligns with my private value of 0.6218. Historically, this bid has previously won when facing lower bids, while also considering my recent outcomes. Bidding at this level may provide an adequate chance to win while maximizing expected utility.
B2: bid=0.9600
  reasoning: Following the calculator's recommendation as it suggests that 0.96 provides the best expected utility. Historical data shows that bidding around this value has previously resulted in wins. This approach balances the potential for utility maximization and consistency in outcomes.
B3: bid=0.3500
  reasoning: Given my private value of 0.3685, I choose to bid 0.35, slightly below my value but above my previous lower bid amounts. This aims to secure a win while minimizing the risk of overpaying, especially considering historical trends show B2 often bids high but not consistently above my private value. The recommended bid of 0.42 seems too high given my past win rates at lower bids.
Winner: B2, Clearing Price: 0.5800
Summary: In ROUND 17 of the auction, bidder B2 emerged victorious with a winning bid of 0.96, resulting in a clearing price of 0.58, which means they were able to secure the item while paying just slightly less than their actual valuation of 0.94. The bidding was relatively competitive, with B1 also submitting the same bid as the clearing price, but ultimately, B2 had the highest offer. The bids suggest some degree of shading, especially from B1, given their bid aligns exactly with the clearing price despite their valuation being higher. Overall, B2’s win reflects a strategic calculation, as they maximized their payoff while still outbidding the competition.

--- ROUND 18 ---
B1: bid=0.0500
  reasoning: The best-response calculator recommends a bid of 0.05, which aligns closely with my private value. Given recent bidding history, the second-highest bids tend to be just below the average competitive range. This bid could help me secure a win while minimizing payment based on competitive tendencies. Additionally, it reflects a calculated risk to maximize my expected utility.
B2: bid=0.1800
  reasoning: The calculator suggests a bid of 0.18 for maximizing utility. Based on past rounds, I'm observing that B1 often bids higher than my private value. Bidding at 0.18 covers my estimated utility potential while avoiding overbidding, given my history.
B3: bid=0.0900
  reasoning: Given my private value of 0.09093542477390693, the optimal strategy is to bid just below my actual value to maximize the chance of winning while minimizing payment. The recent history shows that bids above 0.1 consistently lose, and shading to 0.09 increases utility in a second-price auction setting.
Winner: B2, Clearing Price: 0.0900
Summary: In ROUND 18 of the auction, bidder B2 emerged as the winner with a bid of 0.18, securing the item at a clearing price of 0.09. The bidding was competitive, especially with B3 submitting a bid equal to the clearing price, but ultimately B2’s higher bid guaranteed their victory. The bids suggest some level of shading, particularly from B1, whose bid was significantly below their estimated value. Overall, while B2's payment is well below their valuation of 0.1989, this round highlights their strategic advantage in valuing the item higher than their competitors.

--- ROUND 19 ---
B1: bid=0.5000
  reasoning: Bidding 0.5 allows me to potentially win with a second-highest bid that is below my private value. The recent history shows that bids around my current offering have mostly resulted in wins. I've also noticed that my competitors have recently tended to bid lower than expected, particularly B2 and B3, allowing me to capture utility without excessively inflating the payout.
B2: bid=0.4200
  reasoning: I'm following the calculator's recommendation as it suggests a bid right at my private value, maximizing potential utility while remaining competitive. Analyzing the history, other bidders like B1 often bid higher, indicating they may win with bids above 0.42, so matching the recommendation should keep my chances high.
B3: bid=0.0500
  reasoning: Following the calculator's recommendation, as my private value is low and I may win with a bid of 0.05. Historical bids indicate B1 often bids higher, so 0.05 may maximize my chances of winning while ensuring utility.
Winner: B1, Clearing Price: 0.4200
Summary: In ROUND 19 of the auction, bidder B1 emerged victorious with a bid of 0.5, winning at the clearing price of 0.42. The competition was moderately competitive, with B2 close behind at 0.42, indicating B1's bid was just enough to secure the win without being overly aggressive. B1's bid appears to be slightly shaded given their valuation of 0.51, while B2's bid matches the clearing price, suggesting a truthful approach. Overall, B1 managed to achieve a positive payoff, while B2 and B3 received no payoff, signaling the importance of accurately gauging both bidding strategy and competitive landscape in this auction format.
