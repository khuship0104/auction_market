    "- In this project, we are investigating how different AI agents behave in a simple sealed-bid auction, which is where each agent gets a private value and has to decide how much to bid without seeing anyone else's bids. The main question here is *Given different goals and personalities, how do these agents choose their bids and what kinds of outcomes does that produce?*\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is interesting from a computational social science perspective because auctions are everywhere (ads, markets, resource allocation, etc) and they are a clean way to study strategic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In real auctions, people use shortcuts, worry about risk, try to outsmart each other, or just behave unpredictably. This project mixes AI-generated reasoning with actual computational tools like payoff calculators and simulations. The idea is to see what happens when you combine classical game-theoretic structure with LLM-style decision making. It ends up creating a small ecosystem where different agent types have to reason, compete, and adapt, giving us a more realistic picture than purely analytical models.\n",

    "The system is built around three main agent types running repeated sealed-bid auctions: an AuctioneerAgent that manages the environment, and two bidder types—StrategicBidderAgent and HeuristicBidderAgent—that take different approaches to bidding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Auctioneer** is the coordinator.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Samples private values for each bidder from a configured distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Collects bids, determines the winner and clearing price, and calls tools to compute utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Sends back a compact outcome summary each round, which is also used later for evaluation and plots.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **The Strategic Bidder** is meant to represent a more “game-theoretic” participant:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It is roughly risk-neutral and tries to maximize expected utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It receives its private value and a simple belief model about how others bid.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It uses a best-response tool to scan through candidate bids, simulate many hypothetical auctions, and pick a bid that approximately maximizes expected utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The Heuristic Bidder** is deliberately less sophisticated:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It follows simple rules like “shade my bid by a fixed factor” or “slightly overbid my value.”\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It still has access to payoff calculations but does not run full search/optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Over multiple auctions, it can update its shading parameter based on how often it wins and how much utility it gets, mimicking a rule-of-thumb learner instead of a full optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Tools\n",
    "1. Payoff Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The AuctioneerAgent uses this to finalize the outcome of a real auction round, and bidders can call it to ask: “If I bid X and others behave like this, what would my payoff be?”\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Best-Response Approximator\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The StrategicBidderAgent relies on this to turn “game-theoretic intent” into an actual numeric decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Auction Simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This simulator is mainly used by the Auctioneer. It runs many auctions in a row under fixed strategy profiles to get empirical stats (instead of just one-off outcomes).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interaction Protocol\n",
    "The interaction pattern is a simple single-round loop that can be repeated for many auctions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Auction Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The Auctioneer samples private values for all bidders from a specified distribution (e.g., uniform on [0, 1]).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It builds an AuctionConfig object (auction type, number of bidders, value distribution) and sends each bidder a BidRequest containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Their private value\n",
    "\n",
    "        - The auction configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Optional history of past outcomes (for learning/adjustment)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Bid Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Each bidder processes the BidRequest with its own logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - The StrategicBidderAgent calls the best-response tool to search over candidate bids.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - The HeuristicBidderAgent applies its rule-of-thumb strategy, possibly updating its shading factor using past outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Each agent returns a BidResponse with: bidder_id, bid_amount,  A short reasoning_summary (for logging/interpretability).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Outcome Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "        - The Auctioneer collects all BidResponses, decides the winner and price based on the auction type, and calls the payoff calculator.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - The tool returns an AuctionOutcome with: winner_id, clearing_price, bids, values, payments, and per-agent payoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Feedback and Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The Auctioneer broadcasts a summary (who won, price, each bidder’s payoff) that can be stored for evaluation and optionally fed back into future BidRequest.history for learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this loop many times creates a dataset of auctions that you can analyze: distributions of bids, payoffs, win rates by agent type, and how behavior changes over time.\n",

    "### 1) LLM-Based Decision Making\n",
    "\n",
    "All agent types utilize LLM reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "* We gain the ability to understand the reasoning for each agents bid, rather than a hard-coded outcome.\n",
    "* Ideally, each agent has the ability to learn from previous rounds and be more competitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "* Much more expensive to have three LLM calls per round, for 20 rounds\n",
    "* Runtime is much longer (not too overbearing for 20 rounds, but probably would not scale well)\n",
    "* Lack of reproducibility\n",
    "* LLM hallucination and reasoning failures can cause agents to behave unexpectedly\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Allowing HeuristicAgent to dynamically change shading factor (0.7 - 0.95)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the HeuristicAgent should follow a \"rule-of-thumb\" strategy, our simulation allows small adjustments based on history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "* Can see how reactive the agent is to positive or negative outcomes, if at all.\n",
    "* Adds complexity and realism, preventing agents from being stuck.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "* The LLM's interpretation of \"when to adjust\" may be unclear, even with reasoning provided.\n",
    "* Over only 20 rounds, the agents tended to not show drastic adjustments.\n",
    "* This functionality is the reason HeuristicAgent requires LLM interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) 3 Total Bidders, 1 strategic and 2 heuristic\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "* Simpler\n",
    "* Cheaper\n",
    "* Faster\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "* May lose interesting insights and bidding trends when more factors are involved\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Only Test Sealed-Bid Second-Price (Vickrey) Auction\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not test other auction types (first-price, English, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "* Focus on one auction type for implementation and interpretation\n",
    "* Simple payoff structure and auction setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "* May lose insights into how the different types of agents respond to different setups\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) What is included in \"History\"? \n",
    "\n",
    "The history that is passed to each agent each round contains:\n",
    "* Previous Bids from all agents\n",
    "* Previous Private Values from all agents\n",
    "* Winner ID\n",
    "* Round Index\n",
    "\n",
    "Details not *explicitly* included (although maybe implicit)\n",
    "* Payoffs\n",
    "* Clearing Price\n",
    "* Shading factors\n",

    "Relying on the LLM to correctly infer all the omitted information could result in incorrect choices/reasonings."
